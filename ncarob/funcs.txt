readline - get a line from a user with editing
{
	   readline returns the text of the line read.  A blank line returns
       the empty string.  If EOF is encountered while reading a line,
       and the line is empty, NULL is returned.  If an EOF is read with
       a non-empty line, it is treated as a newline.
